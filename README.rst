MEDICAL DATA REST API
----------------------

A rest api for an app for securely tracking medical records, empowering medical experts to give the best treatment based upon individual patient history.

Refer to the documentation `here <https://johannes1803.github.io/medical-app>`_.

I built this rest api from scratch for my capstone project in the `Udacity Full Stack Developer Nanodegree <https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0044>`_.
